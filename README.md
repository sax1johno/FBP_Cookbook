# FBP_Cookbook

A cookbook of Flow-Based Programming (FBP) flows for accomplishing a variety of tasks that I've found especially useful and interesting.  Flows specifically use the [Node-RED](https://www.node-red.org) flow format and can be imported into any Node-RED installation, but specifically written for use with the [Propl Editor](www.propl.us). 

This cookbook is written using [mkdocs](mkdocs.org).  You can run the docs by cloning this repository and running `mkdocs serve`.
